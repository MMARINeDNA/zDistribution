We selected `r length(unique(detect_data$NWFSCsampleID))` water samples collected at `r length(unique(detect_data$station))` unique locations during the 2019 NOAA hake abundance survey (@fig-bubble), targeting 0, 50, 150, 300, and 500 m sampling depths at each station. Where the bottom was less than 500 m deep, we did not collect a sample at 500 m. We amplified and sequenced these samples in 1 technical replicate using MFU, 3 technical replicates using MV1, and 3-5 technical replicates using DL, resulting in a final total of `r detect_data %>% group_by(primer, NWFSCsampleID) %>% n_groups()` amplified and sequenced samples.

Across all samples, we observed `r sum(detect_data$Detected)` positive detections of `r length(unique(detect_data$BestTaxon))` cetacean species, including 6 baleen whale species, 5 dolphin species, 2 porpoise species, and 3 beaked whale species (@tbl-sp-detects). `r nrow(detect_per_species %>% filter(nDetect > 10))` species were observed more than 10 times, and and additional `r nrow(detect_per_species %>% filter(nDetect < 10))` were observed fewer than 10 times. This includes one detection of a bowhead whale (*Balaena mysticetus*), as well as three detections of Stejneger's beaked whales (*Mesoplodon stejnegeri*). @fig-bubble illustrates the distribution of detections across sampling depths, ignoring x-y distribution, for all cetacean species included in the study.

### Question 1: Does POD vary with depth?

GAM-based model selection of detection probability across sampling depths negated the null hypothesis of no variation across depth. The best alternative model includes significant smooth terms for depth, species, and depth x species interaction (AIC = `r round(min(modelAIC$AIC))`). This model explained 14.3% of variance in eDNA detection probability, *with an AUC of XXX and TSS of XXXX.* 

Broadly, delphinids were more likely to be detected at the surface, beaked whales at depths > 200m, and baleen whales either at the surface or at depths > 400m (@fig-H1POD-species). While detection data from the five species detected fewer than 10 times were included in our model input, we did not make predictions for any of these species.

Species-specific detections were qualitatively highest at depths where they are predicted to spend the most time among the delphinids. Conversely, most beaked whale and baleen whale species in the study were most likely to be detected deeper than where they spend most of their time (@fig-H1POD-species). Most notably, predicted POD-at-depth plots for two of the three baleen whales indicated a high probability of detection at 500 m, while these two species spend most of their time above ~200 m.

Models stratifying detections by taxonomic Family and preferred prey type both had lower AIC values than the model stratified by species (AIC = `r round(filter(modelAIC, model == "m1.2a")$AIC, digits = 0)` and `r round(filter(modelAIC, model == "m1.2b")$AIC, digits = 0)`, respectively); however, these models still had significant terms for Family and depth x Family interactions (taxonomic model) and for depth, prey type, and depth x prey type interactions (prey type model). *Model diagnostics here.* Predicted POD curves for each model illustrate varying trends in POD with depth across strata (@fig-H1POD-family-prey). Similar to the model stratified by species, we did not make predictions for Families with fewer than 10 detections using the taxonomic model, which excluded the Balaenidae (bowhead whale family).

#### Question 2: Does depth variability in POD covary with observation bias?

Technical replication increases probability of detection.

#### Question 3: Does depth variability in POD covary with xy variability?

Our best fit model included terms for species, lat/lon, and depth, as well as species x lat/lon, species x depth, and species x depth x lat/lon (AIC = `r AIC(m3.0c)`). Although terms for depth and lat/lon were not significant, removing these terms increased model AIC to 4947. *Model AUC and TSS here*

Predicted 3D probability of detection for the most frequently detected delphinid, baleen whale, and beaked whale varied with latitute and longitude, while adhering to the broad trends identified in Q1 (@fig-H3PODxy). The Pacific white-side dolphin is most likely to be detected near the surface, with max POD varying between depths of `r min(maxPOD_depth %>% filter(BestTaxon == "Lagenorhynchus obliquidens") %>% pull(depth))` m and `r max(maxPOD_depth %>% filter(BestTaxon == "Lagenorhynchus obliquidens") %>% pull(depth))` m. Generally, detections of Pacific white-sided dolphins that were farther south and east were also more likely to be deeper. 

Depths of highest POD for humpback whales had two peaks around `r min(maxPOD_depth_clipped %>% filter(BestTaxon == "Megaptera novaeangliae") %>% pull(depth))` m and `r max(maxPOD_depth_clipped %>% filter(BestTaxon == "Megaptera novaeangliae") %>% pull(depth))` m; and depths of highest POD for Baird's beaked whales varied between `r min(maxPOD_depth %>% filter(BestTaxon == "Berardius bairdii") %>% pull(depth))` m and `r max(maxPOD_depth %>% filter(BestTaxon == "Berardius bairdii") %>% pull(depth))` m. Lat/lon variability in Baird's beaked whale detections followed a similar pattern to Pacific white-sided dolphins, with greater likelihood of deeper detections in stations that are more to the south and east. The two peaks in depth of greatest POD for humpback whales were roughly distributed with higher probability of detection around 0 m on the continental shelf, and higher probability of detection around 500 m on the shelf break.
