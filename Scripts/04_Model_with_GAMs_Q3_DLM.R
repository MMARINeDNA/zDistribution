# Q3: Does depth distribution of detections vary across xy spatial distribution?
# H3.0: Depth distribution of detections does not vary across xy spatial distribution.
  #H3.0a: xy variability + z variability
  #H3.0b: xyz covariability
  #H3.0c: xyz covariability by species
# H3.1: Depth distribution of detections does not correspond with oceanographic variability.
  #H3.1a: z and oceanography covariability
  #H3.1b: z and oceanography covariability by species

### H3.0c: Depth smoothed over xy with shape and intercept variable by species -

# Amy's version
# Expensive to set up bc it creates a 3D smooth
# and then the by replicates that smooth 16 times
# so, 10 x 5 x 5 x 16 coefficients
# Also estimating 16+ hyperparameters for the smoothing
# and each smoothing parameter costs 10x what a regular parameter costs?
# TL;DR, the te term takes a long time
# by default using a thin plate spline, uses an eigen decomposition (25K x 25K) 
# on the design matrix, then pulls it down to the k = 10 most influential 
# directions. maybe not a good idea bc eigen decomp is happening on a per axis 
# basis so it might make more sense to have a basis with evenly spaced knots
# which would avoid the eigen decomp and avoid making assumptions about
# where the data are (where the splines need to be most flexible)
# also assumes that all taxa are different, which they might be, but we might
# want some to be allowed to be similar/share parameters
# Also te might not be efficient with bam? But DLM can't remember for sure.
# Sys.time()
# m3.0c <- bam(Detected ~ te(depth, lat, lon,

plot(detect_data[,c("depth", "lat", "lon")])

# te can be decomposed into multiple ti terms
# "te produces a full tensor product smooth, while ti produces a tensor product 
# interaction, appropriate when the main effects (and any lower interactions) 
# are also present."
# Using UTM proj coordinates
# d groups lat and lon into one smooth, so 2D smooth on lat/lon
# this is cheaper to set up, and you get a 2D spline
# 1D smooth on depth, and 1D on BestTaxon
# changed depth to k = 5 because there are really only 5 common values
# thin plate for lat/lon and for depth, BestTaxon is a random effect
# first term is the full interaction
# also term for just interaction between lat/lon and BestTaxon
# also term for just interaction between depth and BestTaxon
# this allows you to see which bits are important
# individual ti terms could be estimated as zero, indicating
# that they are not important (hypothesis testing!)

# tensor between spline and random effect is the same as a factor-smooth
# model (Pedersen et al., 2019), where each level of the factor gives a
# related set of basis functions (a spline), but the corresponding
# coefficients are shrunk so we have more parameter efficiency (contrast
# to by= where the smooths are independent)

# I think for ti() terms you always need to include the "main effects"
# that is, if you have ti(x,y,z) you also must include ti(x)+ti(y)+ti(z)
